Visual Tracer allows the user to watch and explore the trace of an executing application. It shows information about the main events as they occur, as well as about the existing instances and their historical values. Visual Tracer has a nice GUI that allows the user to set the status and the speed of the application execution.

Visual Tracer handles both single- and multithreading applications.
